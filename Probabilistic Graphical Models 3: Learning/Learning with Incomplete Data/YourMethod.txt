Describe your method used to recognize the unknown actions here.

My RecognizeUnknownActions implementation:
first, reinitializing the probabilities
second, clustering the poses together using EM_Cluster
last, run RecognizeActions

For training:
seek proper InitialClassProb on datasetTrain1 and save it
then use the proper InitialClassProb to inference on datasetTrain3

As a result, all of the 3rd class example has been predicted as 2nd
class. So it just got 66.667% on the unknown testset(total test cases is
90, all of the 30 3rd class cases has not been correctly predicted).
I have no good idea to improve this speciel mistake.

Also, we can enrich the datasets by adding noise
Case the learning process is too slow
I don't want try it...
